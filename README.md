## ðŸ“Œ Description

Python wrapper around C++ helper to compute the following local geometric features in parallel on CPU:
- linearity
- planarity
- scattering
- verticality
- normal_x
- normal_y
- normal_z
- length
- surface
- volume
- curvature

FAISS is used to compute KNN fast. Support for GPU could be added with small effort
A small `main.py` script helps to add computed features back to a LAS file.

## ðŸ§± Installation

Tested

```bash
# clone project
https://github.com/drprojects/point_geometric_features.git
cd point_geometric_features

# Installation in a dedicated conda environment
bash install.sh
```

## ðŸš€ Demo

```bash
python demo.py
```


## ðŸ’³ Credits
This implementation was largely inspired from [Superpoint Graph](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph). The main modifications here allow: 
- parallel computation on all points' local neighborhoods, with neighborhoods of varying sizes
- more geometric features
- some corrections on geometric features computation
